= node-svc, a microservice learning example

Written for SEIS664, IT Delivery, at the University of St. Thomas (St. Paul, MN). 

A simple Node microservice showing use of node-fetch and express with async logic. Calls itself recursively, effectively implementing an Aggregator pattern (or anti-pattern, if you prefer). Right now the recursion is depth-only, a fanout approach is in the works and ultimately hope to have a randomizable combination of breadth and depth traversal (emulating a mesh of arbitrary complexity). 

Includes simplest possible Mocha/Chai test. Includes a variety of provisioning and configuration resources (shell, Terrform, Packer, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes) and basic Github Actions pipeline for testing, building, pushing to gcr.io, and deploying to Kubernetes. 

Not all scripts are executable; some are for reference only (e.g. logging.sh).
